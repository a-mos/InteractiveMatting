Matting using only user clicks without trimaps
Testing code in ```My test.ipynb```
The model is based on [Deeplabv3](https://pytorch.org/hub/pytorch_vision_deeplabv3_resnet101/) implementation with additional inputs for clicks added from interactive segmentation models. There is also added uncertan blue clickmap for semi-transparent areas.
